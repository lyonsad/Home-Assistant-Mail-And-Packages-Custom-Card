## Lovelace GUI Setup

## Manual Install
Both JS files need to be stored inside the path/to/config/www/ folder. In the Lovelace reource URL path, local is the same as the www folder. Construct your path to the JS inside the www folder for the resurce URL. For the example below:
```
path/to/config/www/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card.js

path/to/config/www/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card-editor.js
```
Configuration > Lovelace Dashboards > Resources

```
url: /local/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card.js
type: Javascript Module
```

## HACS Install

[HACS](https://hacs.xyz) will install the files and add an entry in the Lovelace resource
* Have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) installed in your instance of HASS
* Add URL: **https://github.com/lyonsad/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card** as a custom repository with Type: **LOVELACE**
* Navigate to the Frontend directory
* Search for Mail and Packages, then choose install
* You may need to empty your browser cache for the frontend to recognize the new files.

HACS install path
```
/path/to/config/www/community/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card/
```
Path HACS adds to Lovelace resources
```
/hacsfiles/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card.js
```

## Card Configuration

Add a manual card then input the yaml below.
```
type: 'custom:mail-and-packages-card'
name: Mail Summary
updated: sensor.mail_updated
details: true
image: false
```
Switch to the visual editor and complete the setup by assigning the sensors you have enabled in the [Mail and Packages integration](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages).

#### Walmart and Home Depot
Enable the Walmart and Home Depot package sensors in the integration, then select them in the card's visual editor. You can also add these optional fields to your card YAML (use your actual entity IDs):

```yaml
walmart_packages: sensor.mail_walmart_packages
home_depot_packages: sensor.mail_home_depot_packages
```

Each configured sensor displays a package icon, count, and link to the store's order history alongside the existing carriers. Leave a field unset to omit that store.

#### USPS Mail Image Display
The mail images can be displayed by using the mail_today.gif directly or use a [local file camera entity](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages/wiki/Example-Automations-and-Templates#camera). Use the blue toggle switches to turn either option on or off.

* Mail GIF Location: The mail_today.gif file must be saved in the `www` folder for the front end to load it. If the image is saved directly in the `www` folder you will use the path `/local/mail_today.gif`. Please see the [Mail and Packages Integration](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages/wiki/Configuration-and-Email-Settings#configuration) configuration section for the path the integration should be set to based on the type of HASS installation you are using. Random image file name setting should be turned off. 

* Camera Entity: Set up a [local file camera entity](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/local_file/) described in the [integrations WIKI](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages/wiki/Example-Automations-and-Templates#camera). Set this option to the name of the local file camera entity you created.


#### Delivery Message Sensor
The delivery message sensor, `sensor.mail_delieveries`, is not created by the [Mail and Packages Integration](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages/wiki/Example-Automations-and-Templates#post-0115). You must create a [template sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/). This is left out of the integration on purpose so they can customize as they see fit.

## Maintaining this fork

This fork preserves the original summary layout and adds Walmart and Home Depot counts. Stable numbered releases are installed through HACS. Lit is bundled locally in the downloaded card; no external script host is required.

Development requires Node.js 20.19 or newer and pnpm. Edit the files in `src/`, then run:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

Commit the source, lockfile, tests, and generated `dist/` files together. The editor is included in the main bundle; the editor file in `dist/` remains a compatibility entry point. Tests cover rendering, editor changes, relevant entity updates, missing entities, image recovery, and the actual bundled Lit renderer.
